# Deep Civics Collective

### Examining public technology  

Participation is key to building an equitable and sustainable future. Yet a lack of agency in decision making and agenda-setting is a persistent phenomenon in socio-technical systems writ large. In some cases, these asymmetries of power are intentional manipulations and strategic moves; in others, they are errors of imagination, engineering and design. 

We want to deepen our understanding of how people organize around technologies (e.g., as civic, community, public, citizen) and what these framings enable or constrain. We use words without interrogating their underlying connotations and histories, and in so doing make decisions about technology design that encode our inherent biases and values. Just as software solidifies a process, concepts solidify our politics, and we strive to trace how these concepts shape our work. We seek to uplift and develop design approaches that foster relationships for democratic engagement and participation that lead to transformative change. 

The group works synchronously (In weekly calls on Thursdays 11-12 ET) and asynchronously (through discord) in order to: discuss and share our own research at the intersection of the above, engage with these questions through public scholarship, and study these issues collectively.
